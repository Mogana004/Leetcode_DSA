# brute force approach :
steps :
1) sort the array
2) print  array[1] for second smallest element
3) and print array[ n- 2] index for the second largest element

# optimal approach 
steps :
1)  need to do two traversals
2)  one traversal is to find the largest of the array
3)  and the other is to find the second large which initializes a variable with min value and also checks whether the second largest value is not equal to the largest .
